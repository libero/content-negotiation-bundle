ContentNegotiationBundle
========================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/libero/content-negotiation-bundle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/libero/content-negotiation-bundle)

This is a [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) bundle that will add [content negotiation](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-5.3) to your application by integrating the [Negotiation library](https://github.com/willdurand/Negotiation).

Getting started
---------------

Using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) you can add the bundle as a dependency:

```
composer require libero/content-negotation-bundle
```

If you're not using [Symfony Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html), you'll need to enable the bundle in your application.
